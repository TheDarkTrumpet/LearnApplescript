This repository is a bit of a mismash of scripts, examples, and book code that I'm using to learn Applescript.

## Learn Applescript 
This book was one of the few dedicated books I could find on Applescript.  I'm still going through it, but it's pretty decent.  Focuses on automation with programs that are installed by standard on OSX (Finder, iTunes, etc), and less about other programs.  But, it does explain how to read/parse through the Dictionary.

## DevonThink
This code is located in the Examples/DevonThink directory.  This contains the Applescript code that comes included in DevonThink 3.  The reason for it being here, vs pointing one to there is that the original files are in .scpt format, which is a binary-like format, and difficult to parse/search.  This code has been converted to text (.applescript) with UNIX line endings, meaning searching in the repo, through grep, and so on is a lot easier when learning how to deal with it.  This directory also contains any forum examples that appear to do anything interesting.
